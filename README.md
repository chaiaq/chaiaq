## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Chaiane Quadrado!

ðŸ’¡ Passionate about continuous learning, technology, and creating a positive impact through innovation.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently studying **Systems Analysis and Development**, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. I've participated in programs like **ElasNaTech**, **Cloud Girls**, and **Ladies in Cyber**, which have empowered my journey in tech with community, support, and representation.

ðŸ’» I'm also a **technical mentor at Cloud Girls**, where I support other women who are transitioning into or beginning their careers in technology.

ðŸš€ I'm interested in systems development, digital games, data, virtualization, and anything that allows me to explore and learn something new every day.
